This repo provides plugins for the
[Claude Code marketplace](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/discover-plugins).

## Plugin Overview

| Plugin | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `aichat` | Hooks, commands, skills, agents for session work and search |
| `tmux-cli` | Terminal automation skill |
| `workflow` | Work logging, code walk-through, issue specs, UI testing |
| `safety-hooks` | Prevent destructive operations |
| `langroid` | Design patterns for the [Langroid](https://github.com/langroid/langroid) framework |
| `voice` | Spoken audio summaries |

## Installation

<Steps>

1. **Add the marketplace**

   From your terminal:

   ```bash
   claude plugin marketplace add pchalasani/claude-code-tools
   ```

   Or from inside a Claude Code session:

   ```
   /plugin marketplace add pchalasani/claude-code-tools
   ```

   This creates the **`cctools-plugins`** plugin group.

2. **Install plugins**

   ```bash
   claude plugin install "aichat@cctools-plugins"
   claude plugin install "tmux-cli@cctools-plugins"
   claude plugin install "workflow@cctools-plugins"
   claude plugin install "safety-hooks@cctools-plugins"
   claude plugin install "langroid@cctools-plugins"
   claude plugin install "voice@cctools-plugins"
   ```

   Or use `/plugin` without arguments inside a
   session to launch a TUI for browsing and
   installing.

</Steps>

## aichat Plugin

The `aichat` plugin provides hooks, skills, and
an agent for session management and search.

| Type | Name | What it does |
|------|------|--------------|
| Hook | `>resume` | Type `>resume` (or `>continue`, `>handoff`) to copy session ID and show resume instructions |
| Hook | `>session` | Type `>session` (or `>session-id`) to copy the session ID to clipboard |
| Skill | `/session-search` | Search past sessions (for agents without sub-agent support, e.g. Codex) |
| Skill | `/recover-context` | Extract context from parent sessions into the current conversation |
| Agent | `session-searcher` | Sub-agent to search and retrieve context from past sessions |

:::tip
The `>resume` hook is the quickest way to
continue work when context fills up. It copies
your session ID to the clipboard and shows
instructions -- no need to manually find the
session ID.

## tmux-cli Plugin

| Type | Name | What it does |
|------|------|--------------|
| Skill | `/tmux-cli` | Interact with CLI apps and agents in other tmux panes |

The skill gives Claude Code the ability to send
commands, read output, and coordinate with
processes (including other CLI agents) running
in other tmux panes. See the
[tmux-cli tool page](/claude-code-tools/tools/tmux-cli/)
for full details.

## safety-hooks Plugin

Hooks that block or require approval for
dangerous operations.

| Hook | What it blocks / modifies |
|------|--------------------------|
| `rm` protection | Blocks `rm -rf` on critical paths; requires approval for others |
| `git add` protection | Blocks `git add -A`; requires approval for modified files |
| `git checkout` protection | Warns before discarding uncommitted changes |
| `git commit` protection | Blocks commits without user review |
| `.env` protection | Blocks all read/write/edit of `.env` files; suggests `env-safe` CLI |
| File length limit | Blocks reading files >500 lines to prevent context bloat |

See the
[Safety Hooks detail page](/claude-code-tools/plugins-detail/safety-hooks/)
for hook file descriptions and full documentation.

---

## workflow Plugin

Skills and agents for development workflow tasks.

| Skill / Agent | What it does |
|---------------|--------------|
| `/code-walk-thru` | Walk through files in your editor to explain code or show changes |
| `/log-work` | Log work progress to `WORKLOG/YYYYMMDD.md` |
| `/make-issue-spec` | Create task specs at `issues/YYYYMMDD-topic.md` |
| `ui-tester` agent | Browser-based UI testing via Chrome DevTools MCP |

See the
[Workflow detail page](/claude-code-tools/plugins-detail/workflow/)
for more information.

## langroid Plugin

Design pattern knowledge for the
[Langroid](https://github.com/langroid/langroid)
multi-agent LLM framework.

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|--------------|
| `/patterns` | Index of Langroid design patterns (agent config, tools, task control, MCP integration) |
| `/add-pattern` | Record new patterns as you learn them from the Langroid codebase |

See the
[Langroid detail page](/claude-code-tools/plugins-detail/langroid/)
for more information.

---

## voice Plugin

Get spoken audio feedback when Claude Code
completes a task. The agent automatically speaks
a 1-2 sentence summary before stopping, so you
can multitask while Claude works.

Uses [pocket-tts](https://github.com/kyutai-labs/pocket-tts)
for lightweight text-to-speech.

See the
[Voice detail page](/claude-code-tools/plugins-detail/voice/)
for prerequisites, configuration, architecture
details, and recommended speech-to-text
companions.
