The `workflow` plugin provides a collection of
skills and agents to support everyday development
workflows in Claude Code -- from logging your
progress to walking through code changes and
testing your UI in a real browser.

:::note[Installation]
Part of the `claude-code-tools` package.
See [Quick Start](../../getting-started/) for installation.
:::

Install the plugin via the Claude Code marketplace:

```bash
claude plugin install workflow@cctools-plugins
```

## Skills and Agents

| Type | Name | What It Does |
|------|------|--------------|
| Skill | `/code-walk-thru` | Walk through files in your editor to explain code or show changes |
| Skill | `/log-work` | Log work progress to `WORKLOG/YYYYMMDD.md` |
| Skill | `/make-issue-spec` | Create task specs at `issues/YYYYMMDD-topic.md` |
| Agent | `ui-tester` | Browser-based UI testing via Chrome DevTools MCP |

## Skill Details

### /code-walk-thru

Walks through files in your editor to explain code
or demonstrate changes. Useful for:

- Onboarding teammates to a codebase
- Reviewing what changed in a feature branch
- Creating guided tours of complex logic

Simply invoke the skill and describe which files
or changes you want to walk through:

```
/code-walk-thru walk me through the auth module
```

### /log-work

Logs your work progress to a daily file at
`WORKLOG/YYYYMMDD.md`. This creates a structured
record of what you accomplished, making it easy
to write status updates, standup notes, or
retrospectives.

```
/log-work implemented user auth and wrote tests
```

Each entry is appended to the day's log file with
a timestamp.

### /make-issue-spec

Creates structured task specifications at
`issues/YYYYMMDD-topic.md`. Use this to document
upcoming work, bugs, or feature requests in a
consistent format.

```
/make-issue-spec add pagination to the users API
```

The generated spec includes sections for the
problem description, proposed solution, acceptance
criteria, and implementation notes.

### ui-tester Agent

A sub-agent that performs browser-based UI testing
using the Chrome DevTools MCP (Model Context
Protocol) server. It can:

- Navigate to pages and take screenshots
- Click buttons, fill forms, and interact with
  the UI
- Verify visual elements and page content
- Run end-to-end test scenarios

:::tip
The `ui-tester` agent requires a Chrome DevTools
MCP server to be configured. Ask Claude Code to
help you set this up if it is not already
configured.
:::

To invoke the agent, describe the UI test you
want to run:

```
Use your ui-tester agent to verify the login
page renders correctly and the form submits.
```
