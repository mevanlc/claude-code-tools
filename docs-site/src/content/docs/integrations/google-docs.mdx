## Overview

When working with CLI agents like Claude Code on
writing projects, the most natural generation format
is Markdown. But iterating on those docs via Google
Docs is painful -- uploading a Markdown file to
Google Drive with proper formatting requires multiple
manual steps.

`md2gdoc` reduces this to one command.
`gdoc2md` does the reverse.

## Installation

These tools require additional dependencies. Install
with the `gdocs` extra:

```bash
uv tool install 'claude-code-tools[gdocs]'
```

## First-Time Setup

<Steps>

1. Go to
   [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)

2. Create or select a project and enable the
   **Google Drive API** and the **Google Docs API**

3. Go to **APIs & Services** > **Credentials** >
   **Create Credentials** > **OAuth client ID**

4. Choose **Desktop app**, then download the JSON
   file

5. Save it as `.gdoc-credentials.json` in your
   project directory

6. First run will open a browser for OAuth consent
   (one-time per project)

</Steps>

:::tip
Credentials are project-specific
(`.gdoc-credentials.json` and `.gdoc-token.json` in
the current directory), so different projects can use
different Google accounts.

## Usage

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="md2gdoc (Upload)">

Upload Markdown files as native Google Docs:

```bash
# Upload to root of Drive
md2gdoc report.md

# Upload to a specific folder
md2gdoc report.md --folder "Perf/Reports"

# Upload with a custom name
md2gdoc report.md --name "Q4 Summary"
```

### Conflict Handling

If a file with the same name already exists,
`--on-existing` controls behavior:

- `ask` (default) -- prompt for action
- `version` -- auto-add suffix
  (`report-1`, `report-2`, etc.)
- `overwrite` -- replace existing file

```bash
md2gdoc report.md --on-existing overwrite
```

### Features

- Native markdown conversion (same quality as manual
  upload + "Open in Docs")
- **Image upload** -- local images referenced in
  markdown (e.g. `![alt](diagram.png)`) are uploaded
  to Drive at full resolution, then inserted into
  the Google Doc with proper sizing
- `--max-image-width` controls display width in
  inches (default: 6.5 = full page width)
- `--no-images` skips image processing entirely
- Follows Drive shortcuts to shared folders
- Creates folders if they do not exist

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="gdoc2md (Download)">

Download Google Docs as Markdown files:

```bash
# Download from root
gdoc2md "My Document"

# Download from a specific folder
gdoc2md "My Document" --folder "PNL/Reports"

# Save with a custom name
gdoc2md "My Document" -o report.md

# List docs in a folder
gdoc2md --list --folder PNL
```

### Image Handling

By default, embedded images are extracted to local
files (e.g. `report_001.png`, `report_002.png`)
alongside the markdown, with references rewritten
to use local paths.

- Default -- extract images to files
- `--no-images` -- strip images to placeholders
- `--keep-base64` -- keep base64 data inline
