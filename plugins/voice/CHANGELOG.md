# Changelog

## [1.9.3] - 2026-01-29

### Fixed

- **Stale summary race condition**: When Claude streams responses, thinking
  entries are written to the session file before text entries. If the stop hook
  fired between these writes, it would return the previous message's text
  instead of the current one, causing wrong audio to play. Now resets on every
  assistant entry and retries up to 3 times (150ms delay) if only a thinking
  entry is found, giving time for the text entry to be written.

## [1.9.2] - 2026-01-29

### Added
- **UserPromptSubmit hook**: Injects voice summary instructions at the start of
  each turn, reminding Claude to add a `📢` spoken summary marker
- **PostToolUse hook**: Short reminder after each tool call to keep voice
  instructions fresh during long tool chains
- **voice_common.py**: Shared module for DRY code (config reading, reminder
  building, constants)
- **Silent hook injection**: Uses `additionalContext` instead of `systemMessage`
  to avoid noisy terminal output
- **MAX_SPOKEN_WORDS constant**: Configurable word limit (default 25) in
  `voice_common.py`
- **TTS benchmark script**: `scripts/benchmark_tts.py` for comparing KittenTTS
  vs pocket-tts performance
- **just_disabled flag**: When voice is disabled via `/voice:speak stop`, a
  one-time "do NOT add 📢 summaries" message is injected to counteract earlier
  voice instructions still in context

### Changed
- **Smarter summary extraction**: Extracts inline `📢` markers for instant
  summaries (no API call needed)
- **Word-based length detection**: Uses word count (≤25 words) instead of
  fragile sentence counting
- **Fallback only when needed**: Headless Claude summarization only triggers
  for responses >25 words without a marker
- **Text block joining**: Fixed joining with newlines (not spaces) so `📢`
  markers at start of text blocks are properly detected
- **Quiet Stop hook**: Only shows output when headless Claude generates a new
  summary; otherwise runs silently
- **Flexible word limits**: Explicit summaries (📢 marker or headless Claude)
  use 1.5× the word limit, giving Claude flexibility while preventing runaway
  verbosity. Strict limit only applies to last-resort truncation.

### Improved
- **Tone matching**: Instructions now tell Claude to match user's tone and
  style (including colorful language)
- **Custom prompt support**: User's custom voice prompt (from config) is
  included and noted to override default instructions if conflicting

## [1.8.4] - 2026-01-26

### Initial release
- Stop hook with headless Claude summarization
- pocket-tts integration for voice synthesis
- Configurable voice selection
- Custom prompt support via `~/.claude/voice.local.md`
